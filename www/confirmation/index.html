		<h1>Strategic Focus</h1>
		<h3>What is Zuul?</h3>
		<p>Zuul is a program that drives continuous integration, delivery, and deployment systems with a focus on project gating and interrelated projects.</p>
                <p>It is a distributed, massively-scalable, multi-tenant, multi-cloud service designed to be run on the open Internet safely and securely.</p>
		<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
		<p>To provide software and processes to automate continuous integration, delivery, and deployment of interrelated software projects in a secure manner using project gating.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="slide">
                <h1>Technology Overview - Use Cases</h1>
                <p>Zuul is focused on project gating, especially in scenarios involving multiple repositories with
                   integrated deliverables. Zuul tests speculative future states that would result from landing a change
                   rather than merely the change itself. In this it is unique in the industry.</p>
                <p>Zuul is a scalable multi-tenant service designed to allow consolidation of administration functions,
                   common shared libraries of content and shared test resources while empowering distributed development
                   teams to operate autonomously.</p>
                <p>Zuul content is directly sharable between Zuul installations.</p>
                <p>Zuul is flexible and avoids assumptions about how software is written or deployed. Baremetal, VMs,
                   Containers, Network Switches and Kubernetes are all primary targets that can be mixed and
                   matched. Zuul believes CI isn't just for net-new "cloud native" apps, but should be available to
                   everyone.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="slide">
                <h1>Technology Overview - Architecture</h1>
                <p>Zuul is a distributed system consisting of several components.</p>
                <img src="https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/_images/graphviz-539a1ab06bbf492654bf62087ba8eaa625128067.png">

	</div>
	<div class="slide">
                <h1>Technology Overview - Implementation</h1>
                <p>Zuul is primarily written in Python v3. The web dashboard is in React/Javascript. The zuul-proxy
                   service is in C++.</p>
                <p>Zuul depends on Ansible, Zookeeper, Gearman and an RDBMS. (MySQL and PostGreSQL tested)</p>
                <p>Zuul has code review drivers for Gerrit and GitHub and node provider drivers for OpenStack, AWS, Kubernetes and Static. Support for more are both underway and welcome.</p>
                <p>Zuul publishes tagged releases to PyPI as well as container images from master to Dockerhub.</p>
        </div>
	<div class="slide">
                <h1>Technology Overview - History</h1>
                <p>Zuul was originally written for the OpenStack project and has been running in production at scale
                   since 2012.</p>
                <p>Zuul v3 was released Mar 28, 2018.</p>
                <p>Since then there have been 13 releases, with the latest, 3.7.1 released Mar 25, 2019.</p>
                <p>Zuul is released as needed.</p>
                <p>Zuul does not maintain branches of old code. Zuul is designed and expected to be run CD. The Zuul
                   project considers this a feature.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="slide">
		<h1>Governance</h1>
                <p>Full governance doc can be found at <a href="https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/governance.html">
                    https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/governance.html</a>.</p>
                <p>The Zuul project is self-governing.</p>
                <p>Decisions regarding the project are made by the Zuul Maintainers. They are team of people who are
                   familiar with the project as a whole and act as stewards. They are expected to consider the needs
                   of the entire community.</p>
                <p>Changes to code, documentation, website and other project resources are done via code review. In
                   general, approval of 2 maintainers is sought to approve changes, but depending on circumstances
                   a greater or fewer number may be appropriate.</p>
                <p>Other decisions are discussed on the mailing list. Maintainers strive to achieve consensus on these
                   topics.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="slide">
		<h1>Governance - Membership</h1>
                <p>Membership of the Maintainers is decided by consensus of the Maintainers.</p>
                <p>Existing maintainers are expected to encourage new members.</p>
                <p>There are no artifical limits on the number of Maintainers. A large group of Maintainers is
                   important for the health of the project</p>
                <p>Maintainers are encouraged to become involved in all aspects of the project.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="slide">
		<h1>Governance - Project Lead</h1>
                <p>The Maintainers elect a Project Lead to articulate overall direction and promote consistency.</p>
                <p>The Project Lead does not have any additional rights but does have extra responsibilities.</p>
                <p>The Project Lead must pay particular attention to the overall design and direction, ensure everyone
                   is familiar with that design, and facilitate achieving consensus.</p>
                <p>If the project is unable to reach consensus on an issue, the Project Lead may conduct a poll of
                   Maintainers. In the case of a tie, the Project Lead's vote will be the tie-breaker.</p>
                <p>The Project Lead is elected to a one-year term via Condorcet from a set of self-nominated
                Maintainers. (The current PL was installed 2019-01-14 by unanimous vote of all 13 Maintainers via <a href="https://review.openstack.org/622439">code review</a>; no Condorcet poll was required as only one candidate was nominated.)</p>

		<h1>Open Collaboration</h1>
		<h3>Contributions</h3>
                <p>Current Zuul Maintainers are employed by Red Hat, BMW, OSF, SuSE and GoodMoney.</p>
                <p>All Current Zuul Maintainers have an active role operating a Production Zuul.</p>
		<h3>Policies and practices provide a level playing-field where open collaboration can happen</h3>
                <p>Maintainers are expected to consider the entire community, not just their own individual needs.</p>
                <p>All Zuul decisions are made collaboratively in community interactions.</p>
                <p>Issues found in anyone's Production environment are treated as urgent by all.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="slide">
		<h1>Four Opens</h1>
                <p>Zuul follows the Four Opens.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the Zuul community is closely associated with the OpenDev community, which practices
                   Open Operations. Zuul tags releases after verifying operation at scale in OpenDev.</p>
		<h3>Code of conduct</h3>
		<p>The Zuul Community follows the <a href="https://www.openstack.org/legal/community-code-of-conduct/">OpenStack Foundation Code of Coduct</a>.</p>
		<p>Zuul also behaves as a good neighbor to other confirmed and pilot projects within the OpenStack Foundation.</p>
		<h3>License</h3>
		<p>Zuul is mostly Apache 2. There are some sections of GPLv3 where code is loaded into Ansible processes. The zuul-proxy subproject is GPLv3.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="slide">
		<h1>Active Engagement</h1>
		<p>Zuul has been an active participant at all OpenStack Summits and PTGs since before it was split out from the Infrastructure project.</p>
                <p>Zuul presentations are given at conferences around the world.</p>
                <p>Zuul is being used by OpenLab, the Ansible Community, TungstenFabric and many more.</p>
                <p>Since OpenDev runs Zuul, every OpenStack Foundation project using OpenDev is a collaborator.</p>
